_Comparison_with_larger_containers: Tested SG1, SG2, SG4, SG5, SG6 and SG7 on smaller and bigger rectangular containers
_Damian's results: results from my implemented methods with various parameters on SG1-SG7. Also done EURO datasets for best surround_waste_plus and best bottom_left algo.
_tables_with_results: Excel (and PDF) sheets with nicely summarized and sorted various results,
_time_analysis: results, how much time it took to do various parts of algorithms (in name shape of container + its radius). _surr_waste_plus_intersection_time is a "part" of _surr_waste_plus_time.
